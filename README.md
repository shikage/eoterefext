# Star Wars EotE Reference Manual Extension

This Fantasy Grounds extension is designed to enhance the library and reference functionality available within
modules used with the Star Wars: Edge of the Empire ruleset. It provides the capability to include reference
manuals within your content as is done within the CoreRPG and related rulesets. It also allows module creators
to include Pre-Generated Characters, or Pregens, with their modules and to link a token to those pregens.


## Change List


### v1.1

* Added support for Pre-Generated Characters

### v1.0

* Completed overhaul of UI elements to match the styling of the rest of the ruleset.

### v0.1

* Initial alpha release, basic Reference Manual support but with mostly CoreRPG styling to UI elements.


## Credits/Shoutouts

I would like to thank Trenloe for his assistance in understanding some of the nuances of working with FG extensions and the EotE Ruleset which he has provided to the community, and Lobosolo for providing the font used for the ruleset headers allowing me to better fit this extension to the existing look and feel.
